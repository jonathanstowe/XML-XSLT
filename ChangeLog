	* website/: moved the *.html files to the website directory so
	that we could maintain the sourceforge website in cvs.

	* XSLT.pm: Removed un-needed BEGIN{} section.  This was mostly
	there to test for the proper version of XML::DOM, but this
	function is more properly performed at the time of installation
	and not at run time.

	* XSLT.pm: Removed attempt to call dispose on DOMparser as this
	doesn't actually have a dispose method.  Incremented version
	number to 0.23.

	* XSLT.pm: Changed all the calls to getNodeValue to check that
	the output node actually has the specified attribute before
	attempting the sub method call.  Incremented version to 0.24.

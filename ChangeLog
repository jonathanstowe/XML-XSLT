	* XSLT.pm (__open_by_filename): Got the read-by-url-even-file
	to work.

	* xslt-parser: updated to use the new interface.

	* XSLT.pm: More interface rearranging.  Moved from hashref to
	arrayref.  Moved namespace constants to `use constant'. etc. etc.

	* XSLT.pm: Lots of documenting and interface rearranging.

	* XSLT.pm (dispose): Removed attempt to call dispose on DOMparser
	as this doesn't actually have a dispose method.  Incremented
	version number to 0.23.

	* website/: moved the *.html files to the website directory so
	that we could maintain the sourceforge website in cvs.

	* XSLT.pm: Removed un-needed BEGIN{} section.  This was mostly
	there to test for the proper version of XML::DOM, but this
	function is more properly performed at the time of installation
	and not at run time.

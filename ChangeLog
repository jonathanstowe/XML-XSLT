	* website/: moved the *.html files to the website directory so
	that we could maintain the sourceforge website in cvs.

	* XSLT.pm: Removed un-needed BEGIN{} section.  This was mostly
	there to test for the proper version of XML::DOM, but this
	function is more properly performed at the time of installation
	and not at run time.

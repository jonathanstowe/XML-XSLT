*** THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE ***

Expect the interface to change between versions.

This is a Perl module to parse XSL Transformational sheets. For a description of 
the XSLT, see http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt. Currently, it uses
XML::Parser and XML::DOM, but an effort is being made to use XML::XPath.

XML::Parser is a Perl extension interface to James Clark's XML parser, expat.
It requires at least version 5.004 of perl and can be found on CPAN.

XML::DOM is a Perl module that allows XML::Parser to build an Object Oriented data structure
with a DOM Level 1 compliant interface.

While we are working towards conformance with the W3 spec, this is an
alpha version and the module does not conform to the XSLT working
draft at this moment. New releases will be announced on the perl-xml
mailing list [You can subscribe to this list by sending a message to
subscribe-perl-xml@lyris.activestate.com] and to the XML::XSLT mailing
list [subscribe by sending a message to
xmlxslt-subscribe@listbot.com].

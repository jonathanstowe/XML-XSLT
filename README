This is a Perl module to parse XSL Transformational sheets. For a description of 
the XSLT, see http://www.w3.org/ . It uses XML::Parser and XML::DOM.

XML::Parser is a Perl extension interface to James Clark's XML parser, expat.
It requires at least version 5.004 of perl and can be found on CPAN.

XML::DOM is a Perl module that allows XML::Parser to build an Object Oriented datastructure
with a DOM Level 1 compliant interface.

LWP::UserAgent is a Perl module that enables the user to easily request or post documents or
messages over the WWW.

This is an alpha version and the module is not conform the XSLT woking draft at
this moment. We work very hard to make it conform. New releases will be announced
on the perl-xml mailing list [You can subscribe to this list by sending a message
to subscribe-perl-xml@lyris.activestate.com] and to the XML::XSLT mailing list
[subscribe by sending a message to xmlxslt-subscribe@listbot.com].
